                        * Today, I would like to talk to you a little bit about how web standards get made
                        * And developments that are helping them move forward faster than ever.

                        <aside class='notes'>
                            * (Adobe is working on a couple web standards dealing with text layout)
                            * (I want to talk a bit about the history of text layout)
                            * Two of the specifications Adobe is working on, Regions and Exclusions, deal with making complicated layouts on the web easier.
                            * I figured it might be helpful to provide a framework for this discussion in terms of historical text layout.

                            * At it's simplest, text fills a line, then moves on to the next line
                            * It fills up a rectangular space
                            * In English, a line runs from left to right, and lines are placed from top to bottom
                            * You need enough scroll area to fit the content

                            * As content grows longer, authors may begin to tinker with how it lays out.
                            * For example, this illuminated manuscript runs text through two columns
                            * And avoids this fish-shaped area in the center

                            * Layout content within one big rectangle, and make that rectangle as long as it needed to be to fit the content.
                            * But, we're starting to see some experiments with with different layouts.

                            Web standards are technologies, established by the W3C and other standards bodies, that are used to create and interpret web-based content. These technologies are designed to future-proof documents published on the Web and to make those documents accessible to as many people and devices as possible.

                            * All major browsers do this, some updating pretty much daily.
                            * Some, generally calling themselves an 'experimental channel', can install alongside your existing browser, and automatically update. ZOMG super cool.
                            * Release cycles are also tightening. Some releasing as often as every six weeks.
