                            Web standards are technologies, established by the W3C and other standards bodies, that are used to create and interpret web-based content. These technologies are designed to future-proof documents published on the Web and to make those documents accessible to as many people and devices as possible.

                            * Standards are used to transform markup into websites
                            * That will work as well today as they will 5 years from now
                            * And, due to the nature of the web, will be accessible to many different people using many different devices.

                            * One of the problems in the past has been long release cycles for browsers.
                            * There may be a gap of years between browser versions.
                            * One way of getting early feedback is by releasing test builds, previews of future functionality.
                            * All major browsers do this, some updating pretty much daily.
                            * Some, generally calling themselves an 'experimental channel', can install alongside your existing browser, and automatically update. ZOMG super cool.
                            * Release cycles are also tightening. Some releasing as often as every six weeks.
                            * Regions and Exclusions contributions made to WK, for example, will be available in Chrome in 6 weeks.

                            * Typically, polyfills work by filling in missing functionality in a browser with javascript.
                            * You include a javascript library, use the unimplemented feature, and the javascript will transform it into something the older browser can understand.
                            * Traditionally, these were a way of retrofitting legacy browsers with modern standards.

                            * CodePen, an html sample sharing site, had a series of week-long challenges to see what kind of awesome work people could come up with.
                            * Because Regions had a polyfill, we were able to have one of these challenges be test driving regions and coming up with something awesome.

                            * They also tend to start emerging when specifications are likely to change.
                            * So you may write code that needs to be altered to use native functionality when it comes along.
                            * And finally, because they are running client-side to make adjustments, they can suffer from some performance concerns.
